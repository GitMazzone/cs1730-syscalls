# How to Contribute

Students in my CSCI 1730 class may earn some extra credit by contributing to
this system call example project. It all boils down to this: contribute
something to the project. If your contribution is accepted, then you earn some
extra credit. In order to keep things from getting too out of control, there
is an upper bound on the amount of extra credit that you can earn. In other
words, you cannot fail everything else and get an A in the course simply by
contributing to this project. 

Here are a few ways in which you can contribute:

 * Bug Fix (2 points)
 * Add Inline Commentary (2 points)
 * Add <code>filename.md</code> Commentary (5 points)
 * Add a New Example (5 points)
